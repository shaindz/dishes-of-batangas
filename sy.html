<p class="one">SUMAN YAKAP</p>
<p class="two">INGREDIENTS</p>
2 1/4 cups glutinous rice</br>
1 teaspoon lye water</br>
2 cups water</br>
1 whole banana leaf cleaned</br></br>
<p class="two">INSTRUCTION</p>
Place the glutinous rice in a mixing bowl then pour-in water. Stir and soak for 2 to 3 hours.</br>
Drain excess water from the mixing bowl then add lye water and stir thoroughly. The mixture will turn yellowish. Let stand for 30 minutes. </br>
Prepare the banana leaves. Note: Fresh banana leaves can be heated directly in fire for a very short time. </br>
Arrange the banana leaves by placing the larger leaf first in a flat surface then put the smaller leaf in the center of the larger leaf.</br>
Scoop about 1/4 cup of the rice mixture and place it over the smaller leaf.</br>
Fold the leaf to secure the rice mixture (see video for procedure) and tie with a kitchen twine.</br>
Arrange the folded banana leaves with rice mixture in a cooking pot then pour-in enough water.</br>
Turn-on heat then let boil. Simmer for 80 minutes.</br>
Turn-off heat and transfer the banana leaf covered rice cake on a serving dish.</br>
Serve with white sugar, brown sugar, or latik.</br>
