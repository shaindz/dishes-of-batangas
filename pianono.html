<p class="two">INGREDIENTS</p>
5 pieces eggs</br>
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar (optional)</br>
1/2 cup granulated sugar</br>
1/2 cup milk</br>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract</br>
1/2 cup flour</br>
2 tablespoons cornstarch</br>
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder</br>
3 tablespoons powdered sugar</br>
1 stick margarine, softened</br>
2 tablespoons granulated sugar</br></br>
<p class="two">INSTRUCTION</p>
Separate egg yolks from egg whites. </br>
In a bowl, beat the egg whites using a mixer at low speed for 1 minute or until frothy.  </br>
Sprinkle the cream of tartar on top and continue beating until soft peaks form. </br>
Gradually add 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar, a tablespoon at a time, while continuously beating. </br>
Once all sugar is added, turn up the speed to medium and continue beating the meringue until it forms stiff glossy peaks.</br>  
In a large bowl, cream together the egg yolks, the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until it becomes light in texture and color.</br> 
Sift the flour, cornstarch, and baking powder and add to the egg yolk mixture, mix well.</br>
Gently fold in a third of the meringue into the egg mixture and then add the rest and fold until well combined.</br>
Pour the batter into a 15x10x1-inch pan lined with wax or parchment paper. </br>
Bake in a 375 F oven for about 15 minutes or until the cake is golden.</br>
Remove from the oven and loosen the edges of the cake. Transfer the cake including the wax paper to a rack and allow to cool.</br> 
Dust a wax or parchment paper with powdered sugar and invert cake onto the paper. Gently peel the other wax paper off the cake. </br>
Beginning with the narrow side, roll the cake up together with the wax paper. Let it cool down completely, seam side down, for 10 to 15 minutes.</br>
Once the cake has cooled, gently unroll and spread cake with softened margarine and sprinkle with granulated sugar and re-roll. </br>
Cut into 1-inch thick slices to serve.</br>
