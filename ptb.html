<p class="one">PUTO BAO</p>
<p class="two">INGREDIENT</p>
malagkit (glutinous) rice mixed with ordinary rice</br>
shredded coconut (mature)</br>
purple food coloring</br>
banana leaves</br>
brown sugar</br>
salt</br>
water</br>
cooking oil</br></br>
<p class="two">INSTRUCTION</p>
Soak rice overnight in 3 cups water.</br>
Drain the rice using a strainer then put in a blender and add 1 cup of water from the soaked rice and grind to consistency of thick batter.</br>
After you finish grinding the rice, transfer to a mixing bowl then add sugar and mix until the sugar is completely dissolved.</br>
Then add in the baking powder and mix until the baking powder is dissolved and well combined with the batter. Do not over mix!</br>
Please take note that the consistency should not be too thick or it will become hard like cuchincta nor too thin, which will make the puto soggy. Add more water if it is too thick.</br>
Then cover with cling wrap or wax paper and wait for it to ferment or for the baking powder to react on the batter for 4 hours.</br>
After four hours, stir the batter gently. Transfer to a pitcher so you can easily pour on the puto molds.</br>
Line the molds with banana leaves then pour the batter 2/3 full. Or you can just grease the molds with cooking oil or butter if there are no banana leaves available.</br>
Wrap the lid with a piece of cloth so the water from the steam will not drip on the puto.</br>
Arrange in steamer and steam 30 minutes or if toothpick inserted in center of puto comes out dry.</br>
