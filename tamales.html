<p class="one">TAMALES</p>
<p class="two">INGREDIENTS</p>
1/2 pound chicken</br>
salt and pepper to taste</br>
1 tablespoon canola oil</br>
1 onion, peeled and finely chopped</br>
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</br>
4 cups coconut milk</br>
1 cup chicken broth (reserved from cooking the chicken)</br>
2 1/4 cups rice flour</br>
1 tablespoon atsuete powder, diluted in 1 tablespoon water</br>
1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter</br>
3 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and quartered</br></br>

<p class="two">INSTRUCTION</p>

In a saucepan over medium heat, add chicken and enough water to cover. 
Bring to a boil, skimming scum that may float on top. </br>
When broth has cleared, season with salt and pepper to taste.</br>
Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. </br>
Drain chicken, reserving about 1 cup of the broth. 
Allow chicken to cool to touch and then flake.</br>
In a wide pan over medium heat, heat oil, add onions and garlic and cook until softened.</br>
Add coconut milk and broth and bring to a gentle boil.</br>
Slowly add rice flour, whisking vigorously to prevent lumps. </br>
Cook stirring regularly, for about 3 to 5 minutes or until smooth and resembling a thick paste.</br>
Separate 2/3 of the mixture into one bowl and the remaining 1/3 to another bowl to 1/3 of the mixture.</br>
Add the dissolved annatto and the peanut butter and stir until well combined and evenly colored.</br>
Wash banana leaves and with a paper towel, wipe down any grit or dirt.</br>
Briefly pass through gas flames or soak for a few minutes in hot water until softened and more pliable and set aside.</br>
Scoop about 2 tablespoons of plain mixture on banana leaf and spread to about 3-inches wide.</br>
Scoop about 1 tablespoon of the colored mixture onto the plain mixture and spread across the top.</br>
Arrange the pieces of flaked chicken and sliced hard-boiled eggs on top of the colored mixture. </br>
Fold banana leaves over tamale mixture to fully enclose and tie with kitchen twine to secure.</br>
Arrange prepared tamales on steamer basket and steam for about 20 to 30 minutes or until cooked.</br>
Aarrange tamales in a pot and add enough water to cover. Over medium heat, boil for about 20 to 30 minutes.</br>
Carefully remove tamales from heat and let stand for 1 or 2 minutes to set a little. May be served hot or cold.</br>
