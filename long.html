Close one end of a sausage casing with a knot or tie it with a thin rope or a cooking twine. </br>
Fill the sausage casing with the meat mixture, use a funnel if you have one. </br>
Insert the nozzle of the funnel through the open end of the casing all the way to the closed end.</br>
Scoop the meat mixture, into the funnel and gently pack into the casing, once filled tie a knot to enclose. </br>
To create the links tie a rope or twine around it at every about 2-3 inches interval.</br>
Once in the casing, place them in a tray and put in the fridge for a day or two to dry out. </br>
Pack them in zip locks or cantainer with lid and can be refrigerated for several days. You can also freeze them for longer storage time.</br>
