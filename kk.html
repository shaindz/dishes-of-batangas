In a large bowl, combine goat meat, vinegar and 1 tablespoon salt, marinate in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.</br>
In a pot over medium heat, bring to a boil enough water to cover meat.</br>
Add goat meat and boil for about 7 to 10 minutes or until scum begins to rise, drain goat meat and rinse well.</br>
In the clean pot, combine goat meat, pineapple juice, 4 cups of water and 1 tablespoon salt, bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top. </br>
Lower heat, cover and simmer for about 1-1/2 to 2 hours or until meat is tender but not falling apart./br>
In a wide pan over medium heat, heat oil, add potatoes and cook until lightly browned. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels. </br>
Add carrots and cook until lightly browned, remove from pan and drain on paper towels. </br>
Add bell peppers and cook for about 30 seconds, remove from pan and drain on paper towels.</br>
Remove oil from pan except about 2 tablespoons, add onions, garlic and chili peppers. Cook, stirring regularly, until limp and aromatic. 
Add goat meat and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned.</br>
Add tomato sauce and the 4 cups reserved broth. Bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover and continue to cook for about 30 to 40 minutes or until meat is fork-tender and sauce is reduced.</br>
In a bowl, combine liver spread and about 1/2 cup broth from the pan. Stir until smooth and add to pan. Stir until well-dispersed.</br>
